# volley-tourney
This is a system where volleyball tournament organizers can create tournaments and set the tournament types along with the team brackets.

There are different accounts for the organizer, coach and referee. For now that would be in next iteration, so currently the person running the program has organizer rights.

To run the source code in Eclipse:
1. Right click on java project -> Build path -> Add External Archives -> Select the swingx.jar file in the main folder
